                    <p>“Nate, do you want to order the next muffin? Or should I?” I asked while wiping crumbs off my lap from previous pastries consumed that morning. Nate smiled and kissed me,
“I’ll get it.” He said as he rose and moved toward to counter. We’d already devoured an assortment of muffins, churros and miguelitos. The surface of the table wasn’t visible underneath all the crumbs, tiny white pastry plates, espresso cups, and two open laptops displaying various Spanish national park websites.
The floor around us wasn’t visible either. We had jammed ourselves into the corner of a cafe and barricaded ourselves behind a wall of 80-liter backpacks, hiking boots, tent poles and all the other camping gear which spilled out of our insufficiently spacious luggage. We were desperately searching online for directions out of Barcelona to the first place we could pitch a tent. This particular Barcelona cafe had a wifi system I’d never before encountered, one that deterred the USA-college-town tradition of buying a small cheap coffee and spending the rest of the day occupying space in the cafe, behind the glow of a laptop. On each purchase, I’d receive a receipt containing a wifi password but the wifi password changed automatically every 30 minutes, meaning I needed to get another receipt, meaning Nate and I consumed an unusually large amount of pastries and coffee that morning.
In the weeks leading up to our backpacking trip to Europe, Nate and I had heard amazing things about Barcelona. “You have to see La Sagrada Familia.”
“Go to all the restaurants.”
“The party scene is to die for.”
Our first 24 hours in Barcelona only revealed that the kind of adventure we were looking for, wouldn’t be found in a city. On our first day, our only day in Barcelona we bought a six pack of high gravity beer, a pack of green and gold cans with no English writing. After thanking the owner of the small convenience store, we stepped into the warm sunny day and headed straight for a park that overlooked the whole city. Reaching the outlook over the city required climbing, what seemed like, endless flights of stairs. One after the next, each one unique, made of different stone, heading in a slightly different direction. The only thing each flight had in common was the upward direction.
	Twenty minutes into climbing stairs I had relinquished the beer-carrying-duty over to Nate and hunched over to catch my breath, hands on my knees to hold the weight of my torso and underperforming lungs. Nate, on the other hand, an ex university athlete, never hesitated to showcase my lack of stamina. As I panted, he ran up and down the stairs twice, followed with a pushup-to-handstand combo and topped it all off with a condescending (but loving) kiss on the cheek. I smiled and grimaced at the same time and with my remaining stamina, pushed him away. “Let’s go,” I said and continued up the staircase. There was a 50ft tall fence up ahead, and I wanted to see what it was guarding.

	As we neared the fence, I could start to see the complexity of the fence. As I looked at it, I could only see through at one sharp angle, but if I moved my head, the angle changed. I began to bob my head back and forth and sway my body and because of the properties of the fence, this bizarre dance move was making it possible to piece together what was behind the fence. I glanced over at Nate. He was doing a similar head-bobbing-body-swaying type motion. From anyone else’s point of view, we probably looked like two curious pigeons. I started to make out what was behind the fence, and as the picture came together, I felt a twinge of sadness. The fence contained olympic diving platforms, and olympic swimming pool and bleachers. It looked as though the facilities hadn’t been used since the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.
The diving platforms were chipped and stained brown, the pool was filled with rainwater, and several families of ducks were roaming around the perimeter of the pool. It looked like the setting of a zombie apocalypse video game. My feelings of sadness didn’t only come from the desperate state of the facilities, but also from what Nate must be feeling. Two years ago, Nate had been cut from the University of Michigan’s varsity dive team and I knew he hadn’t dove since. Facilities were simply too hard to come by casually, and I could imagine what Nate must be feeling looking at the olympic dive platforms crumpling away with time.
I put both arms around him and buried my face in his neck. We stared in silence a little longer before starting back up the hill. We were close to the park’s first main field with rolling gardens, and plenty of spots to drink our beer.
We settled in a spot of lush grass, near another couple who were reclined in a bright blue and navy hammock. We cracked open the first two beers and made a toast to our future and the hope of countless hours of our own spent in hammocks. Once we were well rested and a little bit tipsy we began to explore the park. We passed hundreds of families, countless souvenir stands and a famous castle before we veered off the trail and climbed through a hole in the fence that separated the park from the bluffs overlooking Barcelona’s harbor. Castle tours and trinket shopping didn’t yield enough entropy to create the memories we wanted. Once through the fence, we were relieved to be away from the hustle and bustle of the busy park. The world behind the fence was strange. 
It was beautiful behind the fence, tall grass, unpredictable terrain, and the most breathtaking view of the Barcelona harbor. The whole place looked like it has once been a construction site but abandoned and overgrown years ago. As soon as Nate and I started discussing where we could get away with pitching a tent in this secret park, we realized Barcelona might not be our correct destination. 
It was decided, the next morning we’d leave Barcelona and explore the Spanish countryside. We’d find a place where our camping gear stopped being a burden and could instead become our home.
The next morning we woke up and headed straight for an internet cafe, landing ourselves at the aforementioned Barcelona cafe with funky wifi and endless pastries (Fun fact: in Spanish wifi is pronounced wee-fee). It took two hours of snacking and web browsing before Nate and I found directions to a campsite in the countryside in a small town called Montserrat.  We shoved our strewn belongings back into my burnt orange Osprey backpack and Nate’s smoke blue Gregory, hefted them onto our backs, and lumbered out the door. No more than 20 steps down the sidewalk, we reached our subway entrance. Two subways, a train, and a bright yellow gondola later, Nate and I found ourselves outside the gates of a campsite and shucked our backpacks to the dirt to look around.
“It doesn’t look very open” I said. I poked my nose through the campground’s front gate and gripped the metal thatching on either side of my face. Deserted. “We need to start formulating a plan B.”
Pacing, Nate didn’t say anything for a few minutes. Meanwhile, I sat on a log looking defeated. The campsite was empty, the service counter next to the front gate appeared to be boarded up and we were in the middle of nowhere… in Spain. Nothing seemed more comforting to me in this moment than the idea of a pitched tent and a warm sleeping bag. At least both those items were tucked away safely in our possession.
“Worst case, we’ll hike one of Montserrat’s million trails and find a place to sleep just off the trail and just out of sight” Nate said. His words were comforting, and I knew he was right. Before we could start executing our worst case scenario (aka plan B, aka pitch-tent-inconspicuously-off-trail) we spotted a couple walking down the road toward us. I called out,
“Hey! Do either of you happen to know if the campsite is open?”
 	“Did you try the doorbell?” the woman said and pointed to a rope and a small sign that read “timbre”. Of course. The doorbell. Nate pulled the rope, a small bell sounded, and moment later we heard shuffling from within the reception hut.     
An hour later, our tent was pitched, camp set up, and we were already on one of Montserrat’s famous hiking trails. We’d been going for a couple miles before Nate noticed something that would change the whole trip: chalk on the walls. As all rock climbers know, chalk on a wall is evidence of other rock climbers.
“Here,” Nate said and handed me our lunch-pack. He took his shirt off and threw it in my direction. I caught it with my only free hand. As Nate tackled the nearest climbing boulder, I stood there with lunch-pack and shirt dangling from either arm and took a moment to look around at where we were. We stood in a narrow valley made of a combination of rolling boulders and sheer sandy cliffs. Pine trees were sprinkled around in the grooves where they could find enough dirt. Before I could take it all in, a yell broke my concentration.
“Aseguras?” a man’s voice called. Gruff and distant, I couldn’t tell where the voice was coming from. I looked around. “Aseguras?” the man’s voice called again. This time I spotted him. Across the valley on a large flat boulder, the man stood with his hands cupped over his mouth getting ready to call to us again. I waved at him. I didn’t know what he was asking, but I knew it was directed at Nate and me. “Aseguras?” he called again. What did that mean? He pointed to Nate who had scaled several feet up the boulder, each limb playing a crucial role in keeping his body pressed against the stone and keeping him from falling.
“Do you know what he means?” Nate asked. I was the “official” spanish speaker of our duo, but I hadn’t needed to use the language in years. Nor did I know what this mystery-boulder-man was saying.
“I’m thinking,” I said to Nate.
What did aseguras mean? I knew “seguro” meant “safe” in spanish, could “asegurar” mean to “make safe”? If that was the case, the mystery-boulder-man was asking us if we could “make safe”. Then it hit me. He was pointing at Nate who was rock climbing and asking us if we could “make safe”.
“Nate, he wants us to belay for him!” I said.
“Hell yeah!” Nate said, and let go of the wall.
“Si! Podemos asegurar!” I called across the valley to the distant man and gave him the international thumbs up. He motioned us over and started treading away into the pines on the other side of the valley. Nate and I scrambled to catch up. We sprinted down the trail, back the way we came.</p>
