                    <p>So, does the G-Spot exist or not? Do we, women, really have a magic button that produces thigh quivering orgasms or is it all a myth?</p>

                    <p>The truth is, we still don't know. The G-spot has yet to be proven or disproven and has sparked a hot debate between sexual health researchers. Even now, in 2016, we are left with a cloudy and confused understanding of the G-spot where evidence in studies is shaky at best and researchers discredit each other for incompleteness and bais in their studies. In <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/05/g.spot.sex.women/">this article</a>, CNN outlines a few studies that are being disputed. Many researchers admit that despite the large amounts of data collected, more research still needs to be done to officially prove or disprove the heavily disputed G-spot.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">A Brief History of the G-Spot</h2>

                    <p>The sensitive area was first “discovered” by Ernst Gräfenberg in 1950 who based his writings on his “own experience with numerous women” (Pan et al. 2015). He went on to state that this spot could be found in all women with no scientific basis.</p> 

                    <p>In 1981, Addiago resumed research on Gräfenberg’s spot and coined the term G-spot. In Addiago’s case study, he determined that G-Spot stimulation resulted in high levels of arousal and orgasm. Though Addiago gathered anecdotal evidence to support his claims, there was still no anatomical evidence of the G-spot. Even today, the G-spot, though not debunked, is not accepted by experts in human anatomy because of the lack of anatomical evidence.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">What About Squirting?</h2>

                    <p>As early as 1st centruy CE, texts have described what we might consider today as the G-spot as it relates to squirting. The Karma Sutra mentioned an erogenous zone that could give forth “a storm of love water” (Pan et al. 2015). Personally, I feel it's safe to assume that "love water" is referring to female ejaculation, or "squirting", which is caused by the stimulation of the Skene's glands. Skene’s glands are another female anatomical structure that have entered the G-spot debate spotlight. Skene’s glands are located near the alleged G-spot and upon sexual stimulation can secrete fluids analogues to prostate fluids, which can lead to female ejaculation.</p>

                    <p>Today, the relationship between female ejaculation and the G-spot is not fully understood. While some researchers have decided these Skene’s glands must be the answer to the elusive G-spot, other researchers argue that the Skene’s glands lack receptors for touch stimulation and cannot be the G-spot’s anatomical structure. Furthermore, the same researchers argue that because there is no female ejaculation phase, any liquids secreted from the Skene’s glands should be referred to as “female emissions” and not female “ejaculation” which implies an orgasmic ejaculation phase (Pan et al. 2015). Female emissions can occur with or without orgasm (Whipple 2015).<p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">But Cosmo Says...</h2>

                    <p>Magazines feast on the idea that the G Spot is real and release countless articles about how to have “mind blowing” and “insane” orgasms. Articles titled “Yes, You Have a G Spot”, “Cosmo’s G Spot Finder” and “Help Him Find Your G Spot” are among a few example of such titles that profit off of telling women that the G Spot is both real and within reach. By creating this pedestal for the superior G-spot orgasm, magazines are dividing women into two categories: women who can have “insane” orgasms from penetration alone, and women who can’t. Naturally, the women who can’t G-spot orgasm experience both feelings of envy as well as feelings of inadequacy and failure.  These articles leave the “inferior” clitoral-only-orgasmers left to wonder, “who are these mythological women who can experience the G-spot orgasm?” When the answer may, in fact, be no one. Women are spending time and energy chasing after a mythical “vaginal orgasm” and missing opportunities to explore what actually makes them feel good –the clit. </p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Photo by Men's Health magazine</span>


                    <p>Many popular Men’s magazines provide men with tips, tricks and guides to “Master the Woman’s G Spot”. Askmen, a popular website, calls the woman’s G-spot the “Holy Grail of female pleasuring” and provides a diagram to help find the tricky spot. An article from Men’s Health magazine explains in detail how to stimulate the G-spot and promises, “Do this all correctly, and she should experience a deeper, lower-body-shuddering orgasm.” If the existence of the G-spot is not proven, then why are we teaching our men to focus on a possibly non-existent area? Furthermore, none of the articles even mention that the G-spot is still highly disputed and men are learning as fact that the G-spot will give women “body-shuddering orgasms” instead of acknowledging its flimsy evidence. I’d like to speculate that maybe there’s such focus on the G-spot because it brings some importance back to the male penis. The G-spot, if it exists, can be stimulated by the penis during intercourse whereas the clit cannot be directly stimulated by the penis during intercourse. Does this make men feel less guilty about not attempting to stimulate his female partner’s clit during intercourse because he can find some solace in knowing his penis is rubbing against her G-spot?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Our Ongoing History of Ignoring Female Pleasure</h2>

                    <p>In the 1800’s Victorian era, women were taught that the female orgasm caused sickness and disease. Women were taught that only immoral women enjoyed sex and respectable women didn’t (Lavie-Ajayi, Joffe 2009). In the early 1900’s, Freud’s ideas of sexuality became extremely popular and culturally influential. Freud believed that the clitoral orgasm was an inferior orgasm and should only be sought during adolescence. He believed that women must switch to a superior vaginal orgasm in order to become truly feminine and fully mature (sexpert slides from class). It is important to note that Freud invented the idea of a vaginal orgasm with no scientific basis.</p>
                    
                    <p>I believe that Freudian theories, which over the last century have worked their way into our doxas about sex, are still influencing how we see the G-spot today. The G-spot leaves the door open for “vaginal orgasms” and our doxa teaches us to latch onto that idea as “superior”. Magazines among other media create a G-spot hype, which causes feelings of inadequacy and frustration when women are unable to achieve a “thigh-quivering”, “back-arching”, “toe-curling” orgasms. The already limited attention received by the clit is being diverted to the possibly non-existent G-spot and I can’t imagine this shift in focus positively impacts the already astonishing orgasm gap between men and women.</p>

                    <p>As bioethicist Jeffry Spike put it so eloquently, “the G-spot belongs in the same category as angels and unicorns”(Adams 2014), mythological and yet to be proven. Personally, I’ve heard more stories about encounters with angels than I have about encounters with the fairy-tale G-spot orgasm. The fact we still don’t know if the G-spot is fact or fiction is proof that ignoring female pleasure can’t be written off as a mistake of the past.</p>
