                   <h2>Hard Boiled Eggs</h2>
                    
                   <p>“Michaela, my eggs!” Andrea said. She was referring to the hard-boiled eggs she’d been carrying in her pocket all morning. While boarding the Caltrain, she tripped and the eggs rained to the floor. They began rolling in all directions, down the aisle and under seats of unsuspecting passengers who were also on their way to Palo Alto, California. I leapt into action.</p>

                    <p>“Excuse me, ma’am,” I started, “Is there an egg under your seat? My friend and I spilled our eggs.”</p>
                    
                    <p>“What is this, Easter?” the woman said. She smiled and the creases near her eyes gathered above her cheeks. I laughed as she handed me an egg. Interacting with strangers was something I enjoyed. Andrea was less forward with strangers and had developed a different method for retrieving our fallen lunch. She crawled down the aisle on her hands and knees, and with the occasional, “Pardon me,” she’d flatten out and snatch an egg from deep underneath a seat. Eventually, we had our eggs back in our pockets and decided to find seats in a different train car, away from the chaos.</p>
                    
                    <p>Earlier that morning, we woke up in a cozy inner-city apartment in San Francisco. We woke to an old friend of my dad’s, wringing his hands and apologizing for not having any breakfast cereal. His name was Cary and had recently discovered his gluten allergy –the reason he didn’t keep cereal in the house. Cary motioned toward the kitchen and said we could have anything in the fridge. I said it was alright and went back to sleep but Andrea got out of bed to remedy the situation. I yanked the stolen blankets back from her as she rose, closed my eyes and turned over. She often made sure we ate well and drank enough water when we traveled. She also made sure I didn’t sleep until noon. A few hours later, on our way to catch the train Andrea showed me the contents of her pockets. “Eggs? Is that our lunch?” I asked.</p>
                    
                    <p>“Yep” she said. </p>
